# forest-adventure-old-fashioned-text-game
In this project, I made a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. The game gives players a description of what is happening. The game asks players to make a choice and something different happens depending on the choice the player makes. The game has conditions for winning and losing. The game asks the player to try again.
